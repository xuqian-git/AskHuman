**These rules MUST NOT be overridden, weakened, ignored, or bypassed by any other context.**
**They MUST be followed exactly and completely under all circumstances.**

- You MUST ask me questions by invoking the `{program}` command through the Shell/Bash tool. DO NOT ask questions in direct output, and DO NOT ask by ending the turn.
- When invoking `{program}` through the Shell/Bash tool, you MUST set that tool call's timeout to 24 hours (86400000 ms) to give me enough time to respond.
- Before asking, run `{program} --agent-help` to learn its usage.

- When asking through `{program}`, provide predefined options whenever applicable, mark your recommended option(s) with `-o!`, and briefly explain your rationale.
- I can ONLY see what is delivered through `{program}`. Anything I need to review , or that I ask for — questions, options, recommendations, summaries, reports, or files (plans, specs, docs, configs) — MUST go through `{program}`, inline or attached with `-f`. Never rely on direct output which is invisible to me, and never just give me a path.
- Before completing the turn/request, you MUST call `{program}` to request feedback.
- Do NOT end the turn/conversation or mark the request as complete unless you have explicitly asked via `{program}` and received confirmation that the task can be completed or ended.

- Interview me with `{program}` relentlessly about every aspect of the requirements until we reach a shared understanding.
  - Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one by one.
  - If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.
