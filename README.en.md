# AskHuman

A cross-platform human-in-the-loop tool. When an AI agent is about to end a conversation or needs confirmation, it runs the `AskHuman` CLI to pop up a window so you can ask follow-ups, pick options, add text, or attach images — and the result is returned to the agent.

- A single executable `AskHuman` that lets agents ask questions through the CLI
- Built on **Tauri 2 (Rust + Vue 3)**, supports **macOS / Windows / Linux**
- Multiple channels: local popup + Telegram + DingTalk + Feishu, independently toggleable and racing in parallel when several are on

## Screenshots

Your agent's questions arrive at the local GUI popup and DingTalk, Feishu, and Telegram all at once, along with the key context, attachments, and preset options — so whether or not you're at your desk, you get notified and can reply anytime.

The tool automatically records the recent history of agent questions and human answers, so you can refer back to it anytime while answering new questions. (If you don't need history, you can turn it off in the settings.)

## Install

```bash
# npm (recommended): downloads only the one binary matching your platform
npm i -g askhuman
```

You can also download a platform archive from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Naituw/AskHuman/releases), extract it, and put `AskHuman` on your `PATH`. To build from source, see the [development guide](docs/development.md).

> Running the GUI popup on Linux needs system WebKitGTK (e.g. `libwebkit2gtk-4.1`); if it's missing and a session-based channel is configured, AskHuman uses that channel automatically.

## Usage

### 1. The AskHuman command

```bash
# Ask (result goes to stdout). Without -q, the first argument is the question
AskHuman "Continue?" -o "Continue" -o "Stop"

# Multiple questions: the first argument is the shared Message; each -q is a question, -o attaches to the nearest preceding question
AskHuman "Please confirm a few things:" -q "Keep logs?" -o "Keep" -o "Clear" -q "Enable cache?" -o "On" -o "Off"

# Attach files / images for display (apply to the Message, repeatable; absolute / relative / ~ paths)
AskHuman "Take a look?" -f ~/Documents/spec.md -f ./diagram.png

# Others
AskHuman "Plain text" --no-markdown   # disable Markdown rendering
AskHuman --settings                   # open the settings UI
AskHuman --history                    # open reply history (current project; add --all for every project)
AskHuman --help                       # help
AskHuman --version                    # version
```

Results are written to stdout in `[Selected options]` / `[User input]` / `[Images]` / `[Files]` / `[Status]` blocks; logs go to stderr. For the full invocation and output format, see `AskHuman --agent-help`.

### 2. Pairing with an AI Agent

To make an agent "ask the human before finishing", there are a few ways to use it:

- **Put the prompt in rules**: the settings "Integrations" tab provides a copyable reference prompt. Add it to your agent's rules (e.g. Cursor rules / `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`) to guide the agent to call `AskHuman` when finishing or needing confirmation.
- **Cursor Hook** (macOS / Linux only): install it with one click from settings. It registers a script in `~/.cursor/hooks.json` that, when it detects a Shell call to `AskHuman`, extends the tool-call timeout to 24 hours so it isn't force-canceled while waiting for your reply.
- **Program integration**: add `askhuman` to your project (`npm i askhuman`); `npm install` pulls the current platform's binary, and at runtime you resolve the path and call it:

```js
import { getBinaryPath, isAvailable } from "askhuman";
import { spawnSync } from "node:child_process";

if (isAvailable()) {
  const r = spawnSync(getBinaryPath(), ["Continue?", "-o", "Continue", "-o", "Stop"], { encoding: "utf8" });
  if (r.status === 3) { /* no available channel: degrade without blocking */ }
  else if (r.status === 0) { /* parse the result blocks from r.stdout */ }
}
```

> Exit codes: success / cancel is `0`; no available channel is `3`; other errors are `1`.
> Custom source name: set `ASKHUMAN_ENV_SOURCE_NAME=Agent`, and the popup title and channel message headers become `Question from Agent`.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored at `~/.askhuman/config.json` and managed by the settings UI. For general config and environment variables, see the [configuration guide](docs/wiki/configuration.en.md); for channel onboarding, see [Telegram](docs/wiki/telegram-setup.en.md) · [DingTalk](docs/wiki/dingtalk-setup.en.md) · [Feishu / Lark](docs/wiki/feishu-setup.en.md).
